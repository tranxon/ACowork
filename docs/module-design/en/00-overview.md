# ACowork-AI Module Design — Overview

> Version: v1.2 | Last Updated: 2026-04-16

## 1. Design Principles

### 1.1 Workspace Splitting Principles

1. **Binary boundary = Crate boundary**: Gateway and Agent Runtime are different processes, must have independent crates
2. **Shared types in independent crate**: Protocol messages, manifest structures and other types used by multiple crates, placed in `acowork-core`
3. **Heavy dependency isolation**: Grafeo (graph DB + ONNX Runtime), WASM runtime and other heavy dependencies, encapsulated in independent crates for conditional compilation and cross-compilation
4. **Testability**: Each crate can be tested independently, doesn't depend on other crates' runtimes
