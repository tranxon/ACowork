# ACowork.AI Protocol Documentation (Outline)

> This directory is the API reference for the ACowork.AI Gateway. The current architecture uses **two protocols**:
>
> - [HTTP](./http.md) — REST API (non-streaming CRUD, configuration, session queries, global resource management)
> - [MQTT](./mqtt.md) — Real-time event bus + lightweight state synchronization (replaces deprecated gRPC + WebSocket)
>
> Audience: Desktop App frontend, CLI tools, second-party integrators, debugging scripts.
>
> **Evolution History**: Earlier Gateway ↔ Agent Runtime used gRPC, and chat streaming events were pushed via WebSocket; starting from [ADR-033](../../adr/zh/ADR-033-mqtt-replace-grpc-websocket.md), converged to a dual-protocol architecture of MQTT pub/sub + HTTP reverse proxy. gRPC / WebSocket protocol documentation has been retired, and the code has been removed.

## 1. Two Protocols Overview (Current Architecture)

| Protocol | Transport | Server Framework | Default Port | Main Callers | Main Use |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| HTTP/1.1 | TCP | Axum (Rust) | `19876` | Desktop App, CLI, ops scripts, Gateway → Runtime (reverse proxy) | Resource CRUD, configuration, session queries, global resource full management, large data query reverse proxy |
| MQTT 3.1.1 | TCP | rumqttd (embedded broker) + rumqttc (client) | `19875` | Gateway, Runtime sub-processes, Desktop Tauri backend | Real-time event bus, state synchronization, device lifecycle management |

> **Ports and Binding**: All bound to `127.0.0.1` by default (localhost only). Runtime's localhost HTTP server uses random port (`--http-port=0`), only reachable via Gateway reverse proxy. Port and `auth_enabled` can be adjusted in `gateway.toml`'s `[http]` section; MQTT port see [`core/acowork-gateway/configs/rumqttd.toml`](../../../core/acowork-gateway/configs/rumqttd.toml).
> **CORS**: Always permissive (any origin / method / header; without `allow_credentials` — `*` wildcard is mutually exclusive with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, tower-http will panic at build time; frontend fetch's default `credentials: 'same-origin'` doesn't need this header either). Dev (Vite `:5173`) and Prod (Tauri `tauri://localhost`) are both cross-origin access to Gateway `:19876`, hardcoded allowlist is unreliable; local default binds to loopback, no attack surface. Remote deployment security model relies on `auth_enabled` + Bearer Token.

**One-liner responsibility boundaries**:

- **HTTP** carries "**CRUD + full queries + reverse proxy**": all non-streaming scenarios, configuration pulls, large volume message history, large data queries between Gateway ↔ Runtime.
- **MQTT** carries "**event push + state synchronization**": chunk / tool_call / done and other streaming events, device online/offline (Will + Retained), Provider/MCP/Search availability broadcast.
- **Runtime side = MQTT client + localhost HTTP server**: Gateway reverse proxies Runtime's HTTP for large data queries; Runtime itself does not expose external ports.

## 3. End-to-End Typical Conversation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as User
    participant DA as Desktop App
    participant G as Gateway
    participant B as rumqttd Broker
    participant RT as Agent Runtime

    Note over RT,B: Startup: Runtime connects to Gateway via MQTT, handshake + online
    RT->>B: MQTT CONNECT + AgentHello (PUB status/agents/{id})
    B-->>DA: status/agents/{id} = online
    B-->>RT: AgentHelloResult (Provider/MCP/Search lists)

    U->>DA: Input message
    DA->>G: HTTP POST /api/agents/{id}/message
    G->>B: PUB intent/agents/{id}/chat_message
    B-->>RT: intent/agents/{id}/chat_message

    RT-->>B: PUB chat/stream/{session_id} (chunk)
    B-->>DA: chat/stream/{session_id} (chunk)
    RT-->>B: PUB chat/stream/{session_id} (tool_call)
    B-->>DA: chat/stream/{session_id} (tool_call)
    RT-->>B: PUB chat/stream/{session_id} (done)
    B-->>DA: chat/stream/{session_id} (done)

    Note over RT,DA: During long tool execution (ADR-045)
    RT-->>B: PUB chat/stream/{session_id} (tool_progress) every 5s
    B-->>DA: chat/stream/{session_id} (tool_progress)
    DA->>B: PUB sessions/control/cancel_tool (tool_call_id)
    B-->>RT: cancel_tool command
    RT-->>B: PUB chat/stream/{session_id} (tool_result error=Cancelled)
    B-->>DA: tool_result arrives, grey dot collapses

    DA->>G: HTTP GET /api/agents/{id}/sessions/{sid}/messages
    G->>RT: HTTP reverse proxy (localhost HTTP)
    RT-->>G: Session messages JSON
    G-->>DA: Session messages JSON
```

Key Points:

- **HTTP only used for "trigger + query + reverse proxy"**: User message send, large data message history pulls all go through HTTP.
- **MQTT only used for "event push + state synchronization"**: chunk / tool_call / done and other streaming events through MQTT pub/sub, Desktop App subscribes `chat/stream/{session_id}` by session.
- **MQTT does not carry req/res**: Any scenario needing "wait for reply" (large data query, config writeback, Intent triggered ACK etc.) goes through HTTP, which Gateway internally converts to reverse proxy call to Runtime localhost HTTP.

## 4. Common Conventions

### 4.1 Content Type and Character Encoding

- HTTP request/response: `application/json; charset=utf-8`
- MQTT Payload: binary protobuf, separate file [`core/acowork-core/proto/mqtt_payload.proto`](../../../core/acowork-core/proto/mqtt_payload.proto) (independent namespace, doesn't share definition with other protos)

### 4.2 HTTP Error Format

```json
{ "error": "human readable message" }
```

HTTP Status Code Semantics:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 / 204 | Success |
| 400 | Request parameter error |
| 401 | Unauthorized (when auth enabled) |
| 404 | Agent / resource not found |
| 409 | State conflict (e.g. Agent not running) |
| 500 / 502 / 503 | Server error, Runtime not connected |
| 504 | Gateway → Runtime reverse proxy timeout |

### 4.3 Authentication

- When `http.auth_enabled = true`, Gateway generates 256-bit random token at startup, writes to `<data_dir>/http_token`.
- HTTP requests must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- MQTT currently bound to `127.0.0.1`, relies on local loopback protection, **does not perform authentication at protocol layer**; multi-user phase enables rumqttd built-in ACL (see [ADR-033](../../adr/zh/ADR-033-mqtt-replace-grpc-websocket.md)).

### 4.4 Data Discovery Files

Gateway writes the following to `<data_dir>/` after startup:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gateway.pid` | PID + HTTP port (for Desktop App discovery) |
| `http_token` | Bearer token (only when auth enabled) |
