# Skill System

> Version: v3.2 | Last Updated: 2026-04-14

---

Skill is the mechanism for extending Agent behavior patterns. Through Skill Instructions, LLM acquires domain-specific knowledge and operation procedures, gaining specialized behaviors beyond its base capabilities.

The Skill system uses a **two-layer model**: SKILL.md as the static definition layer (publishing state), Grafeo as the dynamic experience layer (runtime state). Skills in debugging phase iterate within Grafeo; once mature, they are committed to SKILL.md.

## 1. Architecture Overview

```
Skill System
├── Definition Layer (static)    ← SKILL.md files, distributed with .agent package
│   ├── YAML frontmatter        Metadata (name, triggers, tool deps, model compatibility snapshot)
│   └── Markdown body           Instruction body (execution steps, notes, output format)
│
├── Experience Layer (dynamic)   ← Grafeo graph nodes, Agent-private
│   ├── SkillDraft              Draft Skill (debugging phase)
│   ├── SkillIteration          Iteration version (snapshot per modification)
│   ├── SkillExecution          Execution record (result of each trial run)
│   └── SkillExperience         Runtime experience of published Skills
│
└── Runtime Integration
    ├── Skill Loader            Load SKILL.md + query Grafeo experience
    ├── Prompt Builder          Merge static definition + dynamic experience + model adaptation
    └── Debug Controller        Debug mode (create/trial run/iterate/publish)
```

**Two-Layer Model Design Principles:**

| Layer | Storage Location | Lifecycle | Distributable | Auditable | Version-controllable |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Definition Layer | SKILL.md | Versioned with .agent package | Yes | Yes (open and read) | Yes |
| Experience Layer | Grafeo | Persisted in Agent workspace | No (private data) | No (graph DB) | No |

Analogy: SKILL.md is the **textbook** (public, standard, shareable), Grafeo experience layer is the **personal notes** (private, practice-based, individual). Only their combination forms complete Skill behavior.

## 2. SKILL.md Format (Static Definition Layer)

SKILL.md uses YAML frontmatter + Markdown body, compatible with the Agent Skills open standard (agentskills.io).

### 2.1 File Location

```
<agent_id>.agent
└── skills/
    └── <skill_name>/
        ├── SKILL.md           # Required, Skill definition
        └── references/        # Optional, supplementary docs, template data
            ├── template.md
            └── examples.json
```

### 2.2 Complete Format

```yaml
---
# === Metadata ===
name: weekly-report
description: Summarize this week's work into a structured weekly report
version: "1.0.0"
author: agent                    # "agent" = Agent self-created, "developer" = developer-authored
source_draft: draft-abc123       # Associated draft ID when Agent self-creates (traceable)

# === Triggers ===
triggers:
  - weekly report
  - summarize this week
  - week recap

# === Tool dependencies ===
tool_deps:
  - memory_recall
  - file_write

# === Platform compatibility (optional) ===
platforms:
  desktop: required              # Desktop required
  mobile: optional               # Mobile optional (behavior may degrade)

# === Model compatibility (publishing snapshot, runtime uses Grafeo as authoritative) ===
tested_models:
  - provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    rating: excellent
  - provider: ollama
    model: qwen3:8b
    rating: good
    note: "Needs flattened instruction adaptation"
---

# Weekly Report Skill

## Execution Steps

1. Use `memory_recall` to retrieve this week's conversation and work records
2. Organize completed items by project
3. Generate a structured weekly report:
   - Items completed this week (with progress notes)
   - Items in progress (with blockers)
   - Plans for next week
4. Use `file_write` to save to user-specified path

## Output Format

Use Markdown format; one section per project; keep within 500 words.

## Notes

- If there are no work records this week, reply "No work records this week"
- Prefer `memory_recall` to get data rather than asking user to repeat
- Default style is concise, unless user explicitly requests detailed version
```

### 2.3 Field Descriptions

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill name, unique within Agent |
| `description` | Yes | Feature description, used for Skill search and display |
| `version` | No | Skill version number (semver) |
| `author` | No | Creator: `agent` (Agent self-learned) or `developer` (developer-written) |
| `source_draft` | No | Draft ID when Agent self-created, for tracing debugging history |
| `triggers` | Yes | Trigger word list, LLM matches based on user input |
| `tool_deps` | No | Built-in / WASM tools depended on; Runtime uses for permission checks |
| `platforms` | No | Platform support declaration, see §2.4 |
| `tested_models` | No | Model compatibility snapshot, see §5 |

### 2.4 Platform Compatibility Declaration

Skills can declare platform support levels, consistent with Tools' platform mechanism (see `12-tool-system.md` §2.1):

```yaml
platforms:
  desktop: required     # Desktop required, mobile install rejected
  mobile: optional      # Mobile optional, behavior may degrade
  # desktop: true       # Short form, equivalent to required
  # mobile: false       # Short form, equivalent to unsupported
```

| Value | Meaning | Mobile Install |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `required` | This Skill core depends on desktop capabilities | Reject install |
| `optional` | Can run degraded on mobile | Allow install, behavior limited |
| Not declared | Default all-platform | Allow install |

**Degradation Scenario Example**: A "DevOps Deploy" Skill depending on the `shell` tool declares `desktop: required` because `shell` is unavailable on mobile. A "News Digest" Skill depending on `web_fetch` is all-platform by default because `web_fetch` is all-platform.

## 3. Grafeo Experience Layer (Dynamic Runtime State)

The experience data the Agent accumulates while using Skills is stored in Grafeo as an enhancement layer over the SKILL.md static definition.

### 3.1 Node Type Overview

```
Grafeo Semantic Memory Layer
│
├─ SkillDraft            Draft Skill (debugging phase, unpublished)
├─ SkillIteration        Iteration version (snapshot per draft modification)
├─ SkillExecution        Execution record (result of each trial run)
└─ SkillExperience       Runtime experience of published Skills (success patterns, failure lessons, user preferences, model compatibility)
```

### 3.2 SkillDraft (Draft Skill)

During debugging, Skills self-created by Agent or guided by user are stored as SkillDraft nodes.

```rust
struct SkillDraft {
    draft_id: String,              // Unique ID (auto-generated, e.g. "draft-abc123")
    skill_name: String,            // Skill name
    description: String,           // Description
    instructions: String,          // Instruction body (Markdown)
    triggers: Vec<String>,         // Trigger words
    tool_deps: Vec<String>,        // Depended tools
    created_at: DateTime,
    updated_at: DateTime,
    status: DraftStatus,           // Draft status
}

enum DraftStatus {
    Draft,       // Newly created, not yet tested
    Testing,     // Currently debugging
    Ready,       // Debug complete, awaiting user confirmation to publish
    Published,   // Published to SKILL.md
}
```

### 3.3 SkillIteration (Iteration Version)

Each time a draft is modified, save a complete snapshot of the current version to form a complete iteration history.

```rust
struct SkillIteration {
    iteration_id: String,
    draft_id: String,              // Associated draft
    version: u32,                  // Iteration round (starting from 1)
    instructions: String,          // This round's instruction content (complete snapshot)
    triggers: Vec<String>,
    tool_deps: Vec<String>,
    change_summary: String,        // Modification note ("Added error handling steps")
    trigger_reason: String,        // What triggered this modification ("Run failure: missing data collection")
    created_at: DateTime,
}
```

### 3.4 SkillExecution (Execution Record)

Complete record of each trial run, associated with draft and iteration version.

```rust
struct SkillExecution {
    execution_id: String,
    draft_id: String,              // Associated draft
    iteration_id: String,          // Which iteration version was executed
    outcome: ExecutionOutcome,     // Execution result
    user_feedback: Option<String>, // User feedback ("Output too long")
    error_detail: Option<String>,  // Failure detail
    duration_ms: u64,              // Execution duration

    // Model info
    model_provider: String,        // "openai" / "claude" / "ollama"
    model_name: String,            // "gpt-4o" / "claude-sonnet-4-20250514" / "qwen3:8b"
    model_params: Option<ModelParams>,
    created_at: DateTime,
}

struct ModelParams {
    temperature: f32,
    max_tokens: u32,
}

enum ExecutionOutcome {
    Success,      // Fully successful
    Partial,      // Partial success (completed but with flaws)
    Failure,      // Execution failure
    Skipped,      // Skipped (e.g. insufficient permissions)
}
```

### 3.5 SkillExperience (Runtime Experience of Published Skills)

After a Skill is published, runtime continues to accumulate experience. This experience is injected as supplement during subsequent executions.

```rust
struct SkillExperience {
    skill_id: String,              // Corresponding SKILL.md name
    usage_count: u64,              // Total usage count
    success_count: u64,            // Success count
    last_used: DateTime,

    // Patterns learned from practice
    learned_patterns: Vec<LearnedPattern>,
    failure_cases: Vec<FailureCase>,
    user_preferences: HashMap<String, String>,

    // Model compatibility
    // Linkage: when success rate for some task class on some model falls below 60%, triggers automatic update of AutobiographicalNode Limitation node
    // See 05-memory.md Phase 2 "Self-evaluation Driven AutobiographicalNode Update"
    model_compatibility: HashMap<ModelKey, ModelCompatibility>,
}

struct LearnedPattern {
    pattern: String,               // "When user only says 'weather', default to current city"
    context: String,               // Scenario in which it was learned
    confirmed_count: u32,          // How many times verified
}

struct FailureCase {
    case: String,                  // "api.weather.com occasionally returns 503"
    workaround: Option<String>,    // Workaround ("Retry usually succeeds")
    occurrence_count: u32,         // Occurrence count
}

struct ModelKey {
    provider: String,
    model: String,
}

struct ModelCompatibility {
    tested: bool,
    test_count: u32,
    success_count: u32,
    last_tested: DateTime,
    rating: CompatibilityRating,
    adaptations: Vec<ModelAdaptation>,
    known_issues: Vec<String>,
}

enum CompatibilityRating {
    Excellent,   // Success rate > 90%
    Good,        // Success rate > 70%, with a few known issues
    Limited,     // Success rate > 50%, requires model-specific adaptation
    Untested,    // Not tested
}

struct ModelAdaptation {
    adaptation: String,            // "Use shorter instructions, avoid complex nesting"
    reason: String,                // "qwen3:8b has low compliance rate for long instructions"
    created_at: DateTime,
}
```

```

## 4. Skill Lifecycle

The complete Skill lifecycle is divided into three phases: creation and debugging, publication, and runtime evolution.

### 4.1 Phase 1: Creation and Debugging (Pure Grafeo)

```
User: learn how to help me summarize weekly reports
       │
       ▼
① Agent creates SkillDraft in Grafeo
   status = Draft
       │
       ▼
② Enter Debug mode, trial run
       │
       ├─ Run 1 → SkillExecution (Failure)
       │   → Agent modifies draft → SkillIteration #2
       │   → Grafeo records failure_case + change_summary
       │
       ├─ Run 2 → SkillExecution (Partial)
       │   → User feedback: "Output too long"
       │   → Agent modifies draft → SkillIteration #3
       │
       └─ Run 3 → SkillExecution (Success) ✓
       │
       ▼
③ Agent marks draft as Ready
   status = Ready
       │
       ▼
④ User review (optional)
   ├─ "View debug history" → display all Iteration and Execution records
   ├─ "Roll back to version 2" → restore SkillIteration #2's instructions
   ├─ "Save draft, continue next time" → status remains Ready
   └─ "Publish" → enter Phase 2
```

**Key Debug Mode Capabilities:**

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Trial run | Execute Skill in Debug mode; results not written to production memory |
| Iterative modification | Agent automatically modifies draft instructions based on execution results |
| History tracing | View any iteration version and its execution records at that time |
| User feedback | User can give feedback on each execution result |
| Draft persistence | Save on interruption, continue next time; draft state fully preserved |
| Model switching | Trial run on different models, verify cross-model compatibility |

### 4.2 Phase 2: Publication (Grafeo → SKILL.md)

After user confirms Skill debugging is complete, Runtime performs the publication operation:

```
① Read SkillDraft final state from Grafeo
   (latest SkillIteration's instructions + metadata)
       │
       ▼
② Generate YAML frontmatter
   name / description / triggers / tool_deps
   Extract from SkillIteration
       │
       ▼
③ Generate tested_models snapshot
   Extract tested models and their ratings from model_compatibility
       │
       ▼
④ Write to skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
       │
       ▼
⑤ Update Grafeo
   ├─ SkillDraft.status = Published
   ├─ Create SkillExperience node
   │   (migrate learned_patterns / model_compatibility from debugging period)
   └─ Associate SkillDraft → SKILL.md
       │
       ▼
⑥ Notify user publication complete
```

**Published SKILL.md Example (auto-generated):**

```yaml
---
name: weekly-report
description: Summarize this week's work into a structured weekly report
version: "1.0.0"
author: agent
source_draft: draft-abc123
triggers:
  - weekly report
  - summarize this week
  - week recap
tool_deps:
  - memory_recall
  - file_write
tested_models:
  - provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    rating: excellent
  - provider: ollama
    model: qwen3:8b
    rating: good
    note: "Needs flattened instruction adaptation"
---

# Weekly Report Skill

(Markdown body from final iteration version's instructions)
```

### 4.3 Phase 3: Runtime and Evolution (SKILL.md + Grafeo Experience)

When a published Skill executes each time, Runtime assembles the complete context:

```
Skill Loader loads SKILL.md (static definition)
       │
       ▼
Grafeo queries SkillExperience node (dynamic experience)
       │
       ├─ No experience node (first use after publication)
       │   → Use SKILL.md original instructions directly
       │
       └─ Has experience node → merge into enhanced Skill instructions:
            │
            ├─ Base instructions from SKILL.md
            ├─ Append learned_patterns as supplementary hints
            ├─ Append user_preferences as constraints
            ├─ Append failure_cases as notes
            └─ Inject current model's adaptations (if any)
       │
       ▼
Execution result written to Grafeo
       │
       ├─ Success → episodic memory + update SkillExperience.success_count
       ├─ Failure → update SkillExperience.failure_cases
       └─ User feedback → update SkillExperience.user_preferences
```

**Self-Learning Closed Loop:**

```
Execute Skill → Record result → Accumulate experience → Enhance next execution
     ↑                                        │
     └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When experience accumulates to a certain level (e.g. learned_patterns exceeds 5, or model_compatibility newly adds a low-rated model), Runtime can prompt the user:

> "weekly-report Skill has accumulated 12 new experiences (3 success patterns, 1 new model adaptation). Suggest entering debug mode to update Skill definition."

At the same time, when failure_cases accumulates more than 3 similar failures, it triggers the Skill ↔ ProceduralNode linkage extraction (see `05-memory.md` Phase 2), generating cross-Skill general behavior patterns.

After user confirmation, merge the experience layer back into SKILL.md, forming a new publication round.

## 5. Model Compatibility

Skill execution effectiveness is strongly related to LLM. The same Skill may perform very differently on different models.

### 5.1 Model Compatibility Records

Each Skill's model compatibility is recorded in two layers:

| Layer | Storage | Content | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Debugging phase | SkillExecution nodes | Model + result per trial run | Precise tracing per test |
| Experience phase | SkillExperience.model_compatibility | Per-model aggregated compatibility data | Runtime decision basis |
| Publishing state | SKILL.md tested_models | Compatibility snapshot | Distribution reference |

### 5.2 Runtime Model Check

When assembling Skill context, Runtime checks current model compatibility:

```
Check current model (model_provider / model_name)
       │
       ├─ Excellent / Good
       │   → Execute normally
       │
       ├─ Limited
       │   → Inject model adaptations as supplementary hints
       │   → Example: "Note: Current model requires simple direct instruction format."
       │
       └─ Untested (first execution on this model)
           ├─ Do not block execution
           ├─ Auto-record execution result in model_compatibility
           └─ If 3 consecutive failures, notify user:
              "This Skill does not perform well on current model;
               suggest switching to verified model or entering debug mode for adaptation"
```

### 5.3 Cross-Model Debugging

Users can switch models for trial run in Debug mode to verify Skill's cross-model compatibility:

```
Debug complete on GPT-4o → Publish
       │
       ▼
Switch to qwen3:8b → Find instruction compliance rate low
       │
       ▼
Debug adaptation on qwen3:8b → Simplify instruction format
       │
       ▼
Publish update → SKILL.md tested_models adds two records
```

## 6. Runtime Integration

### 6.1 Skill Loader

Skill Loader is responsible for loading SKILL.md and querying Grafeo experience:

```rust
struct SkillLoader {
    grafeo: Grafeo,
}

struct LoadedSkill {
    name: String,
    definition: SkillDefinition,      // From SKILL.md
    experience: Option<SkillExperience>, // From Grafeo (may be empty)
    model_adaptations: Vec<String>,   // Current model's adaptation instructions
}

impl SkillLoader {
    /// Load published Skill
    fn load_published(&self, skill_name: &str, current_model: &ModelKey)
        -> Result<LoadedSkill>
    {
        // 1. Read skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
        let definition = self.parse_skill_md(skill_name)?;

        // 2. Query Grafeo's SkillExperience
        let experience = self.grafeo.get_skill_experience(skill_name)?;

        // 3. Extract current model's adaptation instructions
        let model_adaptations = experience
            .as_ref()
            .and_then(|exp| exp.model_compatibility.get(current_model))
            .map(|mc| mc.adaptations.iter().map(|a| a.adaptation.clone()).collect())
            .unwrap_or_default();

        Ok(LoadedSkill { name: skill_name.to_string(), definition, experience, model_adaptations })
    }

    /// Load draft Skill (debug mode)
    fn load_draft(&self, draft_id: &str) -> Result<SkillDraft> { ... }
}
```

### 6.2 Skill Injection in Prompt Builder

Prompt Builder merges static definition and dynamic experience when injecting Skills into System Prompt:

```
System Prompt assembly (Step 5: Skill Instructions)
       │
       ▼
For each loaded Skill:
       │
       ├─ Base instructions
       │   From SKILL.md's Markdown body
       │
       ├─ Experience supplement (if SkillExperience)

### 6.3 Context Trimming Priority

When Token budget is insufficient, Skill content trimming order (see `03-agent-runtime.md`):

| Priority | Content | Trimming Order |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Highest | SKILL.md base instructions | Trim last |
| Medium | Model adaptation instructions | Trim first (loss of quality but not fatal) |
| Medium | Experience supplement (learned_patterns) | Trim second |
| Low | User preferences | Trim first |
| Lowest | Failure lessons (failure_cases) | Trim earliest |

## 7. Design Decision Records

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Two-layer model | SKILL.md (static) + Grafeo (dynamic) | SKILL.md ensures distributability, auditability, version control; Grafeo supports self-learning and experience accumulation |
| Debug in Grafeo | Don't directly modify SKILL.md | Debugging is an exploratory process needing iteration history, rollback, A/B testing; graph database naturally supports this |
| One-way commit | Grafeo → SKILL.md | Like git workflow: iterate in workspace → commit to repo |
| Model compatibility recording | SkillExecution + SkillExperience | Skill effectiveness is strongly related to LLM; different models need different adaptations; must record |
| SKILL.md format | YAML frontmatter + Markdown | Compatible with Agent Skills open standard (agentskills.io), the de facto standard across six major platforms |
| Experience injection not replacement | Merge at runtime, don't modify SKILL.md | Ensure SKILL.md as stable baseline; experience as dynamic enhancement layer overlay |
| Context trimming | Experience layer trimmed first | Base instructions are Skill's core logic; experience is icing on the cake |
| Drafts not in package | SkillDraft only in Grafeo | Unpublished drafts should not be distributed as part of package |

## 8. Future Extensions

### 8.1 Skill Cascading Degradation (Phase 4+)

When a Skill's depended tools are unavailable on the current platform (e.g. mobile `shell` unavailable), Skill should automatically degrade instead of entirely failing.

**Vision:**

- SKILL.md's `tool_deps` mark each dependency as `required` or `optional` (default optional)
- When `required` tool is unavailable, the entire Skill is skipped and not injected into System Prompt
- When `optional` tool is unavailable, the Skill is still injected, but instructions note "this step is unavailable on current platform, please skip"
- When Runtime assembles Skill context, it compares `tool_deps` with current platform's available tool list and generates degraded version instructions

**Design Issues to Resolve:**

- Is "skip a step" clear enough for LLM? Should alternative steps be generated?
- Does degraded Skill execution need to be recorded in SkillExperience? How to distinguish full execution from degraded execution?
- Does SKILL.md need to explicitly declare degradation strategy (like `on_tool_unavailable: skip_step | skip_skill | fallback`)?

These questions need to be answered after the Skill system is stably running, accumulating answers from real scenarios, before detailed design can be done.
