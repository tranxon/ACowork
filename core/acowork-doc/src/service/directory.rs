//! `DirectoryService` trait — operations on a directory node.
//!
//! Covers the directory half of design §4 (POST/PATCH/DELETE on
//! `/api/dirs/:id`). Document CRUD lives in `document.rs`; both
//! implementations share the same `LibraryStore` instance so the
//! per-directory `library.json` mutations stay consistent.
