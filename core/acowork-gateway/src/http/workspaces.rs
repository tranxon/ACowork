//! Static file serving for workspace-backed assets (ADR-055 L2-7).
//!
//! The HTML preview iframe needs raw bytes (HTML / CSS / image binaries);
//! a JSON envelope would break every `<img>`, `<link>`, and `<script>` in
//! the rendered document. Under ADR-055 the Gateway no longer touches the
//! workspace filesystem (ADR-034 rule 3 — "Gateway does not access Agent
//! Runtime local files"), so these routes are now a **thin reverse proxy**
//! to the Runtime's `GET /workspaces/raw/{path}` endpoint, which serves
//! the raw bytes with the correct `Content-Type`.
//!
//! The Runtime is the authoritative owner of workspace config (it writes
//! `<work_dir>/config/agent_workspaces.json`), so `workspace_id`
//! resolution and the path-traversal guard both live on the Runtime side
//! (`RuntimeWorkspaceQueryService::resolve_within`). The Gateway merely
//! forwards the `workspace_id` and file path verbatim.
