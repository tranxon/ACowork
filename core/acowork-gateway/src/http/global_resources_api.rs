//! `GET /api/global-resources` — Runtime active pull endpoint.
//!
//! Returns the current snapshot of all 6 global resource topics. Each
//! value is **base64-encoded `DataEnvelope` protobuf bytes**, structurally
//! identical to the payload that the Gateway would publish on the
//! matching MQTT retained topic:
//!
//! | JSON `topics` key                 | MQTT topic                       | Protobuf message              |
//! |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
//! | `acowork/global/providers`        | `acowork/global/providers`       | `AvailableProviders`          |
//! | `acowork/global/mcps`             | `acowork/global/mcps`            | `AvailableMcps`               |

//!
//! ## Protocol contract: "not ready" vs "empty" (Bug B fix, v2)
//!
//! The endpoint distinguishes two semantically different conditions
//! that the previous implementation conflated under "200 + empty payload":
//!
//! | Gateway `BootstrapPhase`     | HTTP status | Body                                                                  | `Retry-After` |
//! |------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
//! | `Booting`                    | `503`       | `{instance_id, phase, phase_detail, retry_after_seconds, error}`      | `1`–`2`s      |
//! | `Unspecified` (wiring defect)| `503`       | same                                                                  | `2`s          |
//! | `Failed`                     | `503`       | same                                                                  | `10`s         |
//! | `ShuttingDown`               | `503`       | same with `retry_after_seconds: -1` (do not retry)                     | `-1`          |
//! | `Ready`                      | `200`       | full `GlobalResourcesView` (topics may be empty arrays — legitimate)  | N/A           |
//! | `Degraded`                   | `200`       | same as `Ready` (treat as authoritative)                              | N/A           |
//!
//! **Why this distinction matters**: when the Gateway has just unlocked
//! its Vault but no provider has been onboarded yet, the
//! `AvailableProviders` snapshot legitimately contains zero entries.
//! Under the previous "always 200" design the Runtime treated the empty
//! list as "no provider configured" and skipped waiting, causing the
//! first chat to fail with "unexpected error" until a manual
//! `model_switch` re-broke the staleness check (Bug B). With this
//! revision the Gateway returns `503 + Retry-After` while it is still
//! `Booting`, and the Runtime keeps polling (see
//! `acowork-runtime/src/startup/global_resources_pull.rs`) until it
//! sees `200`. The Runtime never writes a half-coherent snapshot into
//! its `AvailableResourceCache` from a `503`.
//!
//! `503` responses are also returned when the Gateway is `Failed` or
//! `ShuttingDown`; `retry_after_seconds: -1` is a sentinel meaning
//! "do not retry, abort the pull".
//!
//! ## Does NOT depend on Runtime being online
//!
//! The Gateway is the authoritative source for these resources (Vault +
//! resource_cache + embed_process). Whether any Runtime is alive does
//! not affect this endpoint's availability, so it lives under
//! §4 (Gateway-native, no Runtime dependency).
//!
//! ## Design trade-off: base64 protobuf vs. inline JSON
//!
//! We deliberately do NOT flatten the 6 protobuf structures into inline
//! JSON because:
//! 1. prost-generated types lack `serde::Serialize` / `Deserialize`
//!    derives; flattening would require adding
//!    `#[derive(serde::Serialize, Deserialize)]` to every message in
//!    `mqtt_payload.proto`, and resolving `oneof`-field `serde` quirks
//!    (tag/flatten) — a wide-blast-radius change.
//! 2. Returning base64-encoded protobuf bytes keeps the HTTP wire format
//!    **bit-identical** to the MQTT wire format: new fields in `.proto`
//!    surface in both channels for free, and the Runtime's handling is
//!    zero-special-case.
//!
//! Total snapshot size is small (typically < 5 KB across all 6 topics);
//! the base64 expansion is negligible.
