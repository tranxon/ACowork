//! Install execution structure — serialization and idempotency for
//! agent package installation.
//!
//! Installation is a *backend* concern: callers submit an intent and
//! must not need to coordinate with each other. Two axes are therefore
//! kept deliberately separate, because conflating them is what allowed
//! a single user intent to land three package instances:
//!
//! | axis | question answered | carrier |
//! |------|-------------------|---------|
//! | serialization | how many installs run at once? | [`InstallScheduler`] (one in-flight per node) |
//! | idempotency | may *this install* be executed twice? | the **instance identity** ([`InstallRequest::instance_id`]) |
//!
//! The unit of an installation is the instance, so the instance id *is*
//! the identity of the job: submitting the same `instance_id` twice
//! (replay, retry, a second caller making the same request) is one
//! install, and a job can never be enqueued twice — which also means
//! two jobs can never race for the same `{agent_id}/{instance_id}/`
//! landing directory.
//!
//! Neither axis constrains **how many instances one package may have**.
//! ADR-073 makes multiple instances of the same `agent_id` a legal
//! state: two installs of the same package with two different instance
//! ids are two jobs, two instances, by design.
//!
//! Declarative "make sure it exists" semantics live in
//! [`InstallKind::Ensure`], and they are a **precondition**, not a
//! deduplication key: an `Ensure` re-checks at execution time whether
//! any instance of the package already exists. That check — not the
//! queue's identity rule — is what collapses two independent "ensure
//! the System Agent is installed" calls into one installed instance.
//!
//! The model is pure data plus a synchronous scheduler — no I/O, no
//! async runtime. Hosts (the Node's install gate, the Gateway's
//! coordinator) own the worker loop and the side effects.
