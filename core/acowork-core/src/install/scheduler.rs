//! Per-node serial install scheduler.
//!
//! This is the reusable middleware between the install data model
//! ([`super`]) and whichever host executes the install: the Node's
//! install gate today, the Gateway's coordinator next. It owns three
//! responsibilities and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. **Serialization** — at most one ticket is in flight. This is a
//!    structural property, not a convention: [`InstallScheduler::take_next`]
//!    refuses to hand out work while a ticket is running.
//! 2. **Instance identity** — a job is identified by the `instance_id`
//!    it will create; re-submitting that id is the same install and is
//!    merged into the accepted job, so no two jobs can ever target the
//!    same landing directory.
//! 3. **Lane ordering** — [`InstallPriority::System`] dequeues before
//!    [`InstallPriority::User`]; FIFO within a lane.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* here: package-level uniqueness. Two different
//! instance ids for the same `agent_id` are both admitted and both run
//! (ADR-073 multi-instance is a legal state). The only package-scoped
//! question this module answers is the [`InstallKind::Ensure`]
//! existence precondition, and it is answered by the host at execution
//! time — not by the queue's identity rule.
//!
//! The scheduler is synchronous and I/O-free so it can be unit-tested
//! without a runtime or a filesystem; the host drives
//! `take_next()` → execute → `finish()`.
