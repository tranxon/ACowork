//! Health and SSE event contracts for Gateway-managed subprocesses.
//!
//! Every Gateway-managed subprocess (embed, LSP relay, etc.) MUST expose
//! `GET /health` and `GET /events` (SSE) endpoints conforming to these
//! contracts. The Gateway supervisor uses `/health` for bootstrap and
//! `/events` for ongoing liveness monitoring.
//!
//! # `/health` endpoint
//!
//! Returns a [`HealthResponse`] JSON body. The `status` field uses one of:
//! - `"ok"` — process is healthy and serving requests
//! - `"degraded"` — process is running but with reduced functionality
//! - `"starting"` — process is still initializing
//!
//! # `/events` endpoint (SSE)
//!
//! Streams [`BusEvent`]s as SSE frames. Event names are defined in
//! [`sse_event`]. The supervisor watches for `heartbeat` events (2s cadence)
//! and treats a 10s gap as a stuck process.
