//! Session control use case.
//!
//! ADR-040: wraps session lifecycle and config mutation operations behind
//! a trait so the gateway loop dispatch does not directly depend on
//! SessionManager internals.
//!
//! **Implementation status (ADR-040 P2-D/H — shelved):** `SessionManager`
//! mutation methods require `&mut self`, which is incompatible with
//! `Arc<dyn SessionControlService>`. The trait currently serves as
//! architectural documentation; the production `gateway_loop::dispatch_inbound`
//! calls `session_manager.*` directly. A future rework of SessionManager
//! to use interior mutability would unlock a proper impl.
