//! Debug protocol use case service (ADR-040 + ADR-048).
//!
//! Defines the [`DebugService`] trait — the business-logic abstraction
//! that the new HTTP routes (`http/debug.rs`) and MQTT events publisher
//! both depend on. The implementation
//! [`crate::usecases::RuntimeDebugService`] (in `debug_service_impl.rs`)
//! delegates to the handler functions in
//! [`crate::debug::handlers`].
//!
//! ## Why a trait (ADR-040)
//!
//! Before ADR-048, the WebSocket server in `debug/server.rs` reached into
//! the `DebugController` directly via closures. HTTP routes would have to
//! replicate that logic or import a concrete server struct. By extracting
//! the business logic into a trait, every transport (HTTP, MQTT, future
//! CLI) depends only on the abstract `DebugService` — keeping the
//! "external adapter → use case → internal module" layering of ADR-040.
//!
//! ## Migration phasing (ADR-048)
//!
//! - **D1** (this commit): trait + impl exist, but are not yet called by
//!   any transport. The WebSocket server still owns the routing closure.
//! - **D2**: HTTP routes call `DebugService` via the late-bind slot.
//! - **D3**: MQTT events publisher is added (transport-level, not via
//!   the trait).
//! - **D4**: WebSocket server is deleted; only HTTP + MQTT remain.
//!
//! All 10 currently-implemented handlers are migrated. The remaining 12
//! (breakpoints / messages / skills / recording) are not in scope for
//! this refactor — they can be added to the trait later without changing
//! the transport wiring.
