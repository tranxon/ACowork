//! [`CancelHandle`] — Arc-shared handle to a per-request cancellation state.
//!
//! Design follows ADR-044 §4.1:
//! - State is a single `AtomicU8` (Active / Cancelled), flipped exactly once.
//! - Wakeups use `tokio::sync::Notify` (level-triggered — see tokio docs).
//! - The structured [`CancellationReason`](super::CancellationReason) is stored
//!   in a `Mutex<Option<_>>` and written only on the winning `cancel()` call.
//!
//! Thread-safety: every method is `&self` and safe to call from any task or
//! OS thread. Cloning is cheap (Arc clone) and all clones share the same
//! underlying state.
//!
//! # Naming
//!
//! The type is called `CancelHandle` (not `CancellationToken`) because the
//! word `token` is reserved inside this project for LLM data units
//! (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`), and using both
//! simultaneously creates ambiguity when reading code. The underlying
//! primitive is the same pattern used across Rust / .NET / C++ / Java
//! ecosystems (`tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`, .NET
//! `CancellationToken`, etc.); we just expose it under a project-local name
//! to keep the codebase free of homonym collisions. See ADR-044 §4.5 for
//! the rename history.

/// A clonable handle to a shared cancellation state.
///
/// Multiple holders observe the same state via cheap `Arc` clones. Any holder
/// can call [`cancel`](Self::cancel) to flip the state to `Cancelled` (idempotent)
/// and wake all current and future waiters of [`cancelled`](Self::cancelled).
///
/// # Per-request lifetime (ADR-044 §4.5)
///
/// Each user-driven request (chat message, debug replay, etc.) is allocated a
/// **fresh** handle inside `SessionCore::begin_new_request`. The previous
/// handle remains valid (the `Arc` keeps it alive) and any future still
/// awaiting it can still complete, but external cancel signal sources
/// (MQTT dispatcher, debug server) no longer target it — they always target
/// the *current* request's handle obtained via
/// [`crate::agent::session_core::SessionCore::cancel_handle`].
///
/// # Lifecycle
/// - Initial state: `Active`
/// - After the *first* `cancel()`: `Cancelled` (state persists for the lifetime
///   of the `Arc`)
/// - Subsequent `cancel()` calls with different reasons are **silently ignored**
///   — first reason wins (see ADR §4.1 "first-wins" semantics; the original
///   reason is preserved for diagnostics).
///
/// # Cancellation race-freedom
/// The `cancelled()` future is safe to await before, during, or after a
/// `cancel()` call from any thread. We check the state *before* awaiting the
/// `Notify::notified()` future, which is sufficient because tokio's `Notify`
/// is level-triggered: once a notification has fired, subsequent `notified()`
/// futures resolve on first poll.
