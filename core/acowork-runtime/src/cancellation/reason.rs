//! Cancellation reason taxonomy.
//!
//! Provides structured metadata for *why* a [`CancellationToken`](super::CancellationToken)
//! was flipped, so downstream code (logging, telemetry, user-visible error
//! messages) can disambiguate "user pressed Stop" from "budget exhausted".
//!
//! Phase 1 keeps the surface minimal: `Debug + Clone + PartialEq + Display`.
//! A future telemetry phase may add `serde::Serialize` if a structured pipeline
//! is wired in — no serde dependency is introduced here to keep Phase 1 scope
//! strictly bounded.
