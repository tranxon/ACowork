//! Per-session state for Agent Runtime.
//!
//! `SessionState` holds all state that is scoped to a single conversation session:
//! history, conversation persistence, loop detector, and budget guard.
//! Each session gets its own independent instance, ensuring isolation
//! between sessions (e.g. loop detection does not cross session boundaries).
//!
//! Phase 1: direct ownership inside AgentLoop.
//! Phase 2: extracted into Session Actor for multi-session concurrency.
