//! ACowork Desktop App — Tauri v2 backend
//!
//! This is the library entry point for the Tauri application.
//! It sets up the Tauri builder with all plugins, commands, and tray.
//!
//! ## Gateway boot flow
//!
//! The local Gateway is **NOT** spawned in the setup hook anymore —
//! that was the source of a long-standing bug where Rust unconditionally
//! spawned a child process on the hardcoded default URL, ignoring the
//! frontend's "remote gateway" setting.
//!
//! The new flow is:
//! 1. Setup hook only wires window/tray/single-instance plugins. No spawn.
//! 2. Frontend (`SplashScreen` init) reads its persisted `settingsStore`,
//!    calls `set_gateway_config(mode, url)` to push config into Rust.
//! 3. If mode = local, frontend then calls `init_local_gateway` which
//!    spawns the child Gateway on `defaults::GATEWAY_HTTP_URL` and waits
//!    for `/health`.
//! 4. If mode = remote, frontend skips spawn and just polls `/health`
//!    on the user-configured URL.
//! 5. After the gateway is reachable, frontend calls `ensure_system_agent`
//!    to auto-install the bundled System Agent if not already present.

// ── System-sleep detection (Windows / macOS / Linux) ────────────────────────
//
// The frontend's old time-gap heuristic (heartbeat + visibilitychange) could
// not distinguish "window minimised for N seconds" from "system slept for N
// seconds", causing false `location.reload()` triggers on normal minimise →
// restore cycles.
//

// Detection now lives in the shared `acowork-mqtt-session` crate
// (`power::detect_resume` / `power::run_power_probe_loop`, ADR-065 Step 1) so
// Desktop / Node / Runtime recover from OS sleep/wake with identical timing.
// The Rust backend samples two monotonic clocks (biased vs unbiased) on each
// `Focused(true)` event and on a 2 s polling task; if the biased/unbiased gap
// exceeds the threshold, the system was genuinely asleep — not merely
// backgrounded.


/// Recovery actions after a system wake.
///
/// Called from both the 2-second polling task and the `Focused(true)`
/// window event handler when [`acowork_mqtt_session::power::detect_resume`]
/// reports genuine sleep. Recovery is a strict, ordered sequence — each
/// step is issued only after the previous one completes, which is exactly
/// what makes it race-free by construction:
///
/// 1. **Rebuild the MQTT connection deterministically** – the OS tears
///    down TCP sockets during sleep, so the old EventLoop is unusable by
///    definition. [`DesktopMqttClient::recover_after_wake`] resets the
///    session state synchronously (so `wait_for_connected` can never read
///    the stale pre-sleep `Connected` value) and requests a fresh client
///    + EventLoop pair.
///
/// 2. **Wait for a real ConnAck** – the webview reload of step 3 is
///    deliberately deferred until after `wait_for_connected` succeeds, so
///    the freshly loaded frontend sees `connected: true` on its very
///    first `get_mqtt_status` / `mqtt-status` signal. Reloading before
///    the reconnect would boot the frontend against a Connecting client
///    and show "Connecting to agent..." for tens of seconds. That UX race
///    was the historical excuse for removing the reload; ordering
///    eliminates the race instead of removing the recovery.
///
/// 3. **Wait for the display stack, then reload the webview** –
///    REQUIRED, never remove. System sleep routinely freezes or kills
///    the WebView2 renderer / GPU compositor (Chromium resume bug): JS
///    timers stop firing, the IPC channel breaks silently, the
///    compositor stops submitting frames and the window shows only its
///    transparent/blurred background. MQTT recovery (steps 1–2) does
///    nothing for a frozen renderer, and any "frontend converges in
///    place" logic only works while the webview JS is alive — after a
///    wake it may not be. The reload is the only deterministic recovery
///    for the renderer and is the programmatic equivalent of the user
///    pressing F5 (which always recovers). It is issued through the
///    native browser-process API `WebviewWindow::reload()` rather than a
///    JS `eval`-only reload, because eval requires a live JS context
///    while the native call forces a fresh renderer even when the old one
///    is frozen.
///
///    The reload is **event-driven, but OS display events are only the
///    first trigger** — they arrive while the WebView2 compositor is
///    still coming back (2026-09-06 real-world wake: a reload issued on
///    the display event executed, yet the window stayed acrylic-only
///    until a manual F5 seconds later). So each attempt waits for the
///    display event (`GUID_MONITOR_POWER_ON` / `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE` via
///    the Windows WndProc subclass, window focus on any platform; 5 s
///    timeout fallback when no event arrives) and then lets step 4
///    decide, empirically, whether that reload really displayed. See
///    [`wake_recovery`] for the full event semantics.
///
///    Immediately before reloading, a best-effort eval sets
///    the `acowork_recovery_reload` sessionStorage flag (with a short
///    grace period so the eval can run inside a thawing renderer).
///    `App.tsx` reads that flag to skip the Splash screen and —
///    critically — re-register the Tauri event listeners destroyed by
///    the reload (`initMqttListener`, `initWorkspaceFsListener`); without
///    them the frontend `mqttConnected` flag stays false and the UI would
///    hang on "Connecting to agent". The flag also arms the first-frame
///    verification of step 4 (only flag-carrying pages fire it). Losing
///    the flag (the eval never runs on a frozen renderer) is a safe
///    degradation: the normal boot path registers the same listeners
///    after the Splash gateway check, which passes instantly because the
///    Gateway survived the wake.
///
/// 4. **Verify the reload actually displayed, then retry on failure** —
///    after each reload the recovery task waits up to 10 s for the page
///    to report its first painted frame: `App.tsx` fires the
///    `desktop_recovery_visible` command from a `requestAnimationFrame`
///    callback, which the GPU compositor drives. It fires only when a
///    frame was genuinely composited after this reload, so neither a
///    thawed old page nor a mounted-but-not-composited page can fake it
///    (heartbeat-based verification was removed on 2026-09-06 for
///    exactly that false positive). If the signal does not arrive — the
///    page never mounted or the compositor is still down — the reload
///    is re-attempted (up to 3 times; the reload cooldown is checked
///    once up front, so failed attempts retry every ~10 s); each retry
///    lands later, so recovery converges once the compositor is
///    genuinely usable, no matter how long that takes.
///
/// **Concurrency guard**: `RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS` prevents overlapping
/// calls.  Although `detect_resume()` atomically updates the clock
/// baseline (so it normally returns `true` only once per sleep event),
/// the polling task and the `Focused(true)` handler could theoretically
/// race on the very first call.  The guard ensures only one recovery
/// task runs at a time, preventing a double `recover_after_wake()` that
/// would reset the connection the first task is waiting on.
///
/// **Regression warning — do NOT remove the webview reload**: a previous
/// refactor (ADR-065 migration, Sep 2026) dropped the reload citing a
/// "race with the reconnection" that the ordered sequence above already
/// eliminates, and replaced it with "frontend converges in place". The
/// consequence was a real-world wake (2026-09-06) where the renderer
/// froze for minutes with no self-healing path until the user pressed
/// F5. MQTT and the webview renderer are independent subsystems: a
/// healthy connection says nothing about a live renderer. Future changes
/// must only harden this sequence — never remove the reload step.

///
/// - **Windows**: `GUID_MONITOR_POWER_ON` power-setting broadcast and
///   `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE`, observed by the WndProc subclass
///   (`win_wndproc.rs`). The display has been powered back on / the
///   mode rebuilt — exactly when a manual F5 starts working.
/// - **macOS**: `NSWorkspaceDidWakeNotification` posted to
///   `[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace].notificationCenter` on every
///   system wake, observed by the long-lived block-based observer
///   installed in `macos_workspace.rs` at process startup. The
///   observer runs on the main thread and feeds the same
///   `signal_display_ready()` entry point. AppKit has no
///   `NSApplicationDidWakeNotification`; NSWorkspace is the only
///   programmatic hook.
/// - **Linux**: `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PrepareForSleep(b)`
///   on the system D-Bus, with the boolean argument set to `false`
///   on the wake edge. Subscribed in `linux_logind.rs` over zbus
///   (`MessageStream::for_match_rule`); the long-lived drain task
///   feeds `signal_display_ready()` on every false edge.
/// - **All platforms**: the main window gaining focus
///   (`Focused(true)`). The user is interacting with the app, so the
///   system is fully usable.
///
/// If no signal arrives (an external monitor that never powered off,
/// a driver that does not broadcast, the OS-level observer failed to
/// install at startup, or the user has not yet touched the window),
/// a bounded 5 s timeout still forces the reload so recovery never
